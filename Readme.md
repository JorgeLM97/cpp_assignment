# C++ Assignment

This repository contains both the source code and the compiled apps for the assignment. It was compiled using g++ in Visual Studio Code, Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.

## Use guide

For this program to work, first open the server and write the output text file path when prompted. Then, open the client and do the same thing. By now the data transmission must have already happened and the information logged in the specified path. After this, press any key to exit both the client and server.
There is also an output example in the assignment folder.

## Experiences

The hardest part for me was the socket communications between the apps. I've had never worked with them before and I spent a whole day researching, watching videos, reading books and both analyzing and trying out code examples.
Also, I had to review my pointers knowledge. It is a simple concept in theory, but at least for me its applications are not entirely obvious at first sight. Im used to working everything with simple variables. At school most of the programming classes didn't focus on C++ advanced concepts or in depth OOP for that matter.
Anyways, I did my best effort in this and managed to get a result im satisfied with.
I had some doubts, I was thinking of adding more entries to the log, like "Socket succesfully created/ Socked creatin failed" or "Binding succesful", etc. But I wanted to follow the instructions given exactly, thats why I didnt add that functionality.

Thanks for reading and I hope we can work together soon!
